## Asset Bundles

Here we have some asset bundles which we are using to place details on our planets.

Note that the `.manifest` files are not required in the shipped mod, however we keep them around since they describe what assets are actually available in the bundles. We can use this to make sure we're writing our paths correctly in our planet configs.
