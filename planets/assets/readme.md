## Assets

It's pretty common practice to put your assets in the planets folder, if only because that folder already exists. Technically these can go anywhere!

This includes image files used for clouds, rings, projection pool stones, slide reels, and planetary terrain as well as xml files used for character dialogue, ship logs, and Nomai text.

These textures and text files are used across all our planets.
